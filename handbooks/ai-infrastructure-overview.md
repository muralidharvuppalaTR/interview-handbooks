## The Big Picture — The Self-Reinforcing Loop

Every PR you create goes through this automated cycle:

```
You write code
     ↓
[Hooks] block mistakes in real-time (before code is even saved)
     ↓
/review skill — you self-check before opening a PR
     ↓
/pr-prep skill — creates a draft PR with proper format
     ↓
[CI: claude-pr-review.yml] — AI reviews every PR automatically
     ↓
[CI: auto-resolve.yml] — AI fixes its own findings (max 3 cycles)
     ↓
Human reviews & approves
     ↓
Merge ✓
     ↓
If a pattern keeps appearing → /enforce-pattern → permanent hook/rule added
     ↓
Next PR is cleaner because the safety net is stronger
```

Each iteration the loop catches more — it literally teaches itself over time.

---

## Layer 1 — Foundation Files (CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md)

These are the "instructions manual" that all AI agents read first before doing anything.

### CLAUDE.md — AI workflow instructions

**What it does:** Tells Claude which skill to use for which scenario, enforces the mandatory workflow,
and sets up skill routing.

**The mandatory workflow every coding task must follow:**

```
1. /plan        ← for 3+ files or 2+ projects
2. Approve stack ← you confirm PR boundaries first
3. /implement   ← one task at a time
4. Verify       ← build + tests pass
5. /simplify    ← modifies code (3 parallel refactoring agents)
6. /review      ← reports findings (does NOT modify code)
7. /pr-prep     ← creates the draft PR
```

> **Why simplify THEN review?** `/simplify` changes code. `/review` inspects code. You always inspect
> what you're shipping, so review must come after simplify.

### AGENTS.md — Codebase rules for all AI tools

**What it does:** Tool-agnostic rules (works with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, anything). Defines the
architecture layers, protected files, and verification gates.

**Architecture layers — never reference upward:**

```
Webservice (controllers)
    ↓
Domain (services / business logic)
    ↓
Core + Common (models, utilities)
    ↓
Conduit (legacy C++/COM bridge — CRITICAL, never modify Transport/)
```

**Protected files — touching these triggers a deeper checklist automatically:**

| File | Risk | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| `Startup.cs` | Middleware order is load-bearing | Specialist agent dispatched |
| `ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs` | All API errors depend on this | Specialist agent dispatched |
| `UserContextMiddleware.cs` | Auth for every request | Specialist agent dispatched |
| `TRTA.Conduit/Internal/Transport/*` | Binary protocol to C++ engine | Specialist agent dispatched |
| `ContainerSetup.cs` | DI registrations for entire app | Full checklist applied |

---

## Layer 2 — Rules (18 Files in `.claude/rules/`)

Rules are loaded automatically when relevant context is detected. They are kept short by design —
key constraint inline, link to full doc.

### How rules work

```
You start editing UserContextMiddleware.cs
    ↓
Claude sees the file path matches context: "Editing auth middleware"
    ↓
.claude/rules/user-context.md is loaded automatically
    ↓
Claude now knows: never weaken JWT validation, test both auth paths, etc.
```

### The 18 rules and when they activate

| Rule | Activates When | Key Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| `csharp.md` | Editing any `.cs` file | NPoco not EF Core, `_camelCase` fields, `ErrorDetails` not `ProblemDetails` |
| `testing.md` | Editing test files | NUnit 3 only (except Webservice.Tests), FluentAssertions `.Should()`, AAA pattern |
| `security.md` | Auth / middleware / input handling | Parameterized SQL only, `[M2MAuthorize]` on M2M endpoints |
| `performance.md` | Service / repository code | No DB calls in loops, never `.Result` / `.Wait()` |
| `conduit-safety.md` | Editing `TRTA.Conduit/` | Never modify `Transport/`, get team review, run Conduit tests |
| `container-setup.md` | Editing `ContainerSetup.cs` | Correct lifetime (Transient/Scoped/Singleton), no captive dependencies |
| `startup-middleware.md` | Editing `Startup.cs` | Middleware order is critical — CORS before MVC, error handling early |
| `error-middleware.md` | Editing `ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs` | Response shape is `ErrorDetails`, never `ProblemDetails` |
| `user-context.md` | Editing `UserContextMiddleware.cs` | Never weaken JWT validation, test M2M and user paths |
| `controller-checklist.md` | Adding / modifying controllers | `SetLogContext()` first, `[EnableCors]`, `[Route]`, DI only |
| `severity-rubric.md` | During any review | Decision tree: blocker → suggestion → nit → question |
| `pr-review.md` | Reviewing PRs | Architecture layer violations, test coverage, no `.Result` |
| `planning.md` | Entering plan mode | 3+ files = plan required, every feature is a stack |
| `stacked-prs.md` | Planning multi-PR features | ≤100 lines = 1 PR, tests ship with code (never separate PR) |
| `documentation.md` | Architecture changes | Update CLAUDE.md / rules in same PR as the code change |
| `gh-cli-workarounds.md` | Using `gh` CLI | Never `gh pr edit` (GraphQL bug) — use `gh api` REST instead |
| `automation-decision-tree.md` | Converting review findings | Wrong tech → hook; naming → editorconfig; structural → CI script |
| `continuous-learning.md` | Discovering new patterns | Save to `.claude/rules/` immediately, don't wait |

### The severity rubric — decision tree example

When `/review` or `claude-pr-review.yml` finds an issue, it must classify it using this decision tree
(first match wins):

```
Is there an unhandled exception on a reachable code path?  → [blocker]
Is it a security vulnerability?                            → [blocker]
Is it data corruption or silent data loss?                 → [blocker]
Is there zero test coverage on a new public method?        → [blocker]
Is a new service missing from ContainerSetup.cs?           → [blocker]
Is it a missing edge-case that would give wrong results?   → [suggestion]
Is it a pattern / convention deviation?                    → [suggestion]
Is it naming, formatting, comment wording?                 → [nit]
Is the intent unclear?                                     → [question]
```

Each `[blocker]` and `[suggestion]` also gets a **fixability tag** that drives auto-resolve:

| Tag | Meaning | Auto-resolve behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `[auto-fixable]` | Fix describable in ≤2 sentences from codebase info | `auto-resolve.yml` attempts the fix |
| `[needs-discussion]` | Requires domain knowledge or judgment | Skipped, flagged for human |
| `[pre-existing]` | Not introduced by this PR | Noted, does not block merge |

---

## Layer 3 — Hooks (10 Files in `.claude/hooks/`)

Hooks run automatically on every tool call. They are the real-time enforcement layer — mistakes are
caught before code is even written.

### How hooks are wired (`.claude/settings.json`)

```json
"hooks": {
  "SessionStart": [
    { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .claude/hooks/branch-freshness-check.js" }] }
  ],
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "node .claude/hooks/diff-size-warning.js" },
        { "type": "command", "command": "node .claude/hooks/security-reminder.js" },
        { "type": "command", "command": "node .claude/hooks/technology-guard.js" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "WebFetch",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .claude/hooks/github-url-guard.js" }]
    }
  ],
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .claude/hooks/auto-format.js" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Exit codes:** `0` = advisory warning (allow the action). `2` = hard block (prevent the action).

### The 10 hooks — what each does

| Hook | Trigger | Block or Warn | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `branch-freshness-check.js` | SessionStart | Warn | "Branch is 22 commits behind main — rebase before PR" |
| `technology-guard.js` | PreToolUse Edit/Write | **Block** (exit 2) | Claude writes `DbContext` → instantly blocked |
| `security-reminder.js` | PreToolUse Edit/Write | Warn | SQL string interpolation detected → warning shown |
| `diff-size-warning.js` | PreToolUse Edit/Write | Warn | Edit makes diff >600 lines → "Consider splitting" |
| `github-url-guard.js` | PreToolUse WebFetch | Warn | WebFetch on GitHub URL → "Use `gh api` instead (rate limit)" |
| `pre-commit-size-check.js` | PreToolUse Bash | Warn | Large changeset before `git commit` |
| `todo-accumulation-check.js` | PreToolUse Bash | Warn | TODO/HACK accumulation detected before commit |
| `auto-format.js` | PostToolUse Edit/Write | N/A | Runs `dotnet format` automatically after every edit |
| `post-test-failure-hint.js` | PostToolUse Bash | N/A | Test failed → suggests specific debug steps |
| `pr-title-validator.js` | Bash (PR creation) | **Block** (exit 2) | PR title missing `AB#12345 ` prefix → blocked |

### technology-guard.js — step-by-step example

```
Claude tries to write this to a .cs file:
─────────────────────────────────────────
  public class MyRepo : DbContext      ← EF Core
  {
      public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
  }
─────────────────────────────────────────

technology-guard.js runs (PreToolUse — before write happens):
  → Sees DbContext  → adds to blockers[]
  → Sees DbSet<     → adds to blockers[]
  → blockers.length > 0 → process.exit(2)

Claude Code sees exit code 2:
  → Edit is BLOCKED
  → Error shown: "[BLOCKED] EF Core Pattern Detected —
     This project uses NPoco micro-ORM. Use db.Fetch<T>() instead."
  → Claude corrects itself and uses NPoco
```

**What technology-guard.js blocks (zero-false-positive patterns):**

| Pattern Detected | Why Blocked |
|---|---|
| `DbContext`, `DbSet<`, `AsNoTracking`, `modelBuilder.Entity` | EF Core — project uses NPoco |
| `[Fact]`, `[Theory]`, `[InlineData]` (outside Webservice.Tests) | xUnit — project uses NUnit 3 |
| `Console.Write`, `Console.WriteLine` | Use Serilog via `ILoggerFactory.GetLogger(this)` |
| `ProblemDetails`, `return Problem(` | Use `ErrorDetails` + `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` |
| `Thread.Sleep` | Use `await Task.Delay()` |
| `IDistributedCache` | Use `ICacheManager` or `IConduitCache` |

---

## Layer 4 — Skills (12 Active Skills in `.claude/skills/`)

Skills are project-local overrides of Claude's built-in commands. When a skill file exists at
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, it **overrides** the built-in skill of the same name.

### Precedence

```
.claude/skills/   (project)   ← highest priority — wins
~/.claude/skills/ (global)
Built-in skills               ← lowest priority — overridden
```

### The 12 skills and their purpose

| Skill | When to Use | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `/plan` | New feature, multi-file changes | Explores codebase → proposes stack (PR boundaries) → task decomposition → saves manifest |
| `/implement` | Each task from a plan | Pattern-aware code generation with codebase search |
| `/review` | Before every PR | Self-review with 16-point checklist, severity classification, automatable pattern detection |
| `/simplify` | After implement, before review | 3 parallel agents refactor for clarity, reuse, efficiency |
| `/pr-prep` | Ready to submit | Pre-flight checks → PR title with `AB#` → draft PR creation |
| `/resolve-and-loop` | After reviewer comments | Fetch comments → fix blockers → build → test → commit → push → resolve threads |
| `/quickfix` | Known bug | Combines plan + implement + verify in one flow |
| `/debug` | Unknown bug | Systematic root-cause investigation |
| `/test-gen` | Coverage gaps | Generates tests matching existing project patterns |
| `/enforce-pattern` | Recurring review pattern | Creates a permanent hook, rule, or CI check |
| `/execute-plan` | Multi-PR stacks | Orchestrates task execution with PR boundary checkpoints |
| `/story-status` | Resuming across sessions | Reads stack manifest → shows what is done / pending |

### What the `/review` skill does (vs. built-in)

| | Built-in `/review` | This project's `/review` |
|---|---|---|
| Rules loaded | None | `severity-rubric.md`, `csharp.md`, `security.md`, `testing.md`, `controller-checklist.md` |
| Technology bans | None | EF Core, Console.Write, ProblemDetails, xUnit, IDistributedCache — checked via grep |
| Agent dispatch | No | Up to 3 parallel agents (`feature-dev:code-reviewer`, `silent-failure-hunter`, protected-file specialist) |
| Output format | Free-form | Structured `<!-- F-1-N -->` finding IDs + `REVIEW_METRICS` HTML comment (parsed by `auto-resolve.yml`) |
| Protected files | None | Deeper checklist triggered for `Startup.cs`, `ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs`, `Internal/Transport/*` |
| Fixability tags | No | `[auto-fixable]` vs `[needs-discussion]` — drives whether `auto-resolve.yml` attempts the fix |

---

## Layer 5 — CI/CD Workflows (7 Workflows in `.github/workflows/`)

### Workflow map

| Workflow | File | Loop Stage |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code agent | `claude.yml` | Stage 1 — automated issue-to-PR |
| Claude PR Review | `claude-pr-review.yml` | Stage 2 + 4 — review + enforcement issue creation |
| Auto-Resolve PR Findings | `auto-resolve.yml` | Stage 3 — automatic blocker/suggestion resolution |
| AI Label Sync | `ai-label-sync.yml` | Labels PRs with `ai-assisted` / `ai-generated` |
| AI Metrics | `ai-metrics.yml` | Tracks loop health metrics |
| AI Rule Sync Check | `ai-rule-sync-check.yml` | Validates rules haven't drifted from code |
| Doc Review | `doc-review.yml` | Reviews documentation changes |

## End-to-End Example — Adding a New API Endpoint

**Scenario:** Add customer address validation endpoint (ticket AB#12345).

### Step 1 — `/plan AB#12345 add customer address validation endpoint`

```
Plan skill:
  1. Fetches AB#12345 from ADO (if MCP configured)
  2. Analyzes codebase: finds existing validation patterns, controllers
  3. Estimates scope: ~180 production lines → 1 PR stack
  4. Output:
     Stack: 1 PR (~180 lines). No decomposition needed.

     Tasks:
     Task 1: AddressValidationRequest model + FluentValidation validator (Core)
     Task 2: AddressValidationService (Domain)
     Task 3: Register service in ContainerSetup.cs (Domain)
     Task 4: AddressValidationController action (Webservice)
     Task 5: Unit tests for service (Domain.Tests)
     Task 6: Integration tests for controller (Webservice.Tests)
```

### Step 2 — `/implement Task 1`

```
Implement skill:
  1. Reads existing models in Core for patterns
  2. Writes AddressValidationRequest.cs
  3. Writes AddressValidationRequestValidator.cs (FluentValidation)

  During every edit:
    → technology-guard.js runs (blocks EF Core, Console.Write, etc.)
    → auto-format.js runs after each file (dotnet format)
```

### Step 3 — `/review`

```
Review skill (project-local, overrides built-in):
  1. Reads: git diff main...HEAD (auto-injected)
  2. Loads: severity-rubric.md, csharp.md, security.md, testing.md, controller-checklist.md

  For each changed file — 16-point checklist:
    ✓ Hallucinated APIs? (Grep to verify they exist)
    ✓ DI registration in ContainerSetup.cs? → MISSING → [blocker]
    ✓ SetLogContext() in controller action? → MISSING → [suggestion]
    ✓ Tests have .Should() assertions (not just mock.Verify())?
    ✓ No sync-over-async (.Result / .Wait())?

  Universal pattern scan (grep all .cs files):
    ✓ EF Core patterns → none
    ✓ Console.Write → none
    ✓ .Result / .Wait() → none

  Protected file check:
    ContainerSetup.cs in diff → runs container-setup.md checklist

  Output:
    ## Self-Review Findings
    ### Blockers
    <!-- F-1-1 -->[blocker] [auto-fixable] **ContainerSetup.cs** —
      AddressValidationService not registered. First request will throw
      InvalidOperationException.

    ### Suggestions
    <!-- F-1-2 -->[suggestion] [auto-fixable] **AddressValidationController.cs:18** —
      SetLogContext() missing. Breaks Datadog request correlation.
      [automatable: HOOK_UPDATE]
```

### Step 4 — Fix blockers, then `/pr-prep AB#12345`

```
PR-prep skill:
  1. Pre-flight:
     - Commits behind main: 2 ✓ (under 15 threshold)
     - dotnet test → all pass ✓
     - Uncommitted changes? → none ✓
  2. Diff size gate:
     180 production lines ✓ (under 400 threshold)
     Breakdown: "180 production + 220 tests + 15 config = 415 total"
  3. Self-review gate: "Have you run /review? (yes)" ✓
  4. Ticket detected: AB#12345 (from branch name)
  5. Creates draft PR:
     Title:  "AB#12345 Add customer address validation endpoint"
     Labels: ai-generated
     Body:
       ## Summary
       - Adds POST /api/v3/address/validate endpoint
       - FluentValidation for all input fields
       - Integrated with existing error handling pattern

       ## AI Tooling
       - [x] ai-generated — Code primarily generated by AI
       - [x] Claude Code
  6. Output: https://github.com/tr/us-IncomeTax.../pull/156
```

### Step 5 — `claude-pr-review.yml` runs in CI (automatic)

```

## The Enforcement Loop — How It Gets Smarter Over Time

When the same pattern keeps appearing in reviews, a `static-check-automation` issue is created:

```
Issue created automatically:
  Label: static-check-automation
  Title: "SetLogContext() missing in controller action methods"
  Body:
    Pattern: SetLogContext() not called at start of async action methods
    Appeared in: 3 PRs this sprint
    Suggested enforcement: HOOK_UPDATE
    Detection: grep for "async Task" + "[HttpGet|HttpPost|HttpPut|HttpDelete]"
               without SetLogContext() in first 5 lines
```

You (or an agent) runs `/enforce-pattern`:

```
/enforce-pattern skill:
  1. Reads the issue
  2. Classifies: "Missing method call" → HOOK_UPDATE
  3. Adds detection to technology-guard.js (or creates new hook)
  4. Creates PR: "enforce: warn when SetLogContext() missing in controller actions"

After merge:
  Every future PR → hook warns before the edit even saves
  No more review comments for this pattern
```

**The compounding effect:** Each enforcement PR makes the next 10 PRs cleaner. Over a sprint, the
review comments shift from "missing SetLogContext()" to architecture-level observations — because
the basics are now caught automatically.

## FAQ — Common Questions

### Who reviews and who resolves? Is Copilot involved?

**No — it is Claude end-to-end.** Claude reviews the PR and Claude resolves its own findings. Copilot is not part of this loop.

claude-pr-review.yml triggers → Claude Opus 4.6 reviews the diff
     ↓
Claude posts structured review comments (F-1-1, F-1-2...)
     ↓
auto-resolve.yml triggers → Claude again (same model, NOT Copilot)
     ↓
Claude reads each [auto-fixable] finding → fixes → commits → pushes → resolves threads
     ↓
claude-pr-review.yml re-triggers on the new push (Round 2)
     ↓
Clean → done. New findings → auto-resolve runs again (max 3 cycles)
```

**Why Claude for both?** The findings use a structured format (`<!-- F-1-N -->` IDs, `[auto-fixable]`/`[needs-discussion]` tags, `REVIEW_METRICS` block) that the resolve skill understands. The reviewer and resolver must speak the same schema to coordinate across rounds. A different tool (Copilot, CodeRabbit, etc.) would not understand this format.

**Why the git history mentions Copilot:** Earlier commits reference "Copilot review feedback" — those are from before this AI infrastructure was built, when Copilot was the PR reviewer. The current setup replaced Copilot review with Claude review + auto-resolve.

### Can I use this with Copilot or other AI tools?

The **rules** (`.claude/rules/`) and **AGENTS.md** are tool-agnostic — any AI agent can read them. The **hooks**, **skills**, and **CI workflows** are Claude Code-specific. To use with another tool, you would need to reimplement the skills and workflow files for that tool's format.

### What if auto-resolve cannot fix a finding?

After 2 failed attempts on the same finding, it is downgraded to `stuck` and skipped. After 3 total cycles, the loop exits and posts an "Auto-Resolve Exhausted" comment. The finding is flagged for human review — a developer must resolve it manually.

### What is the difference between `/review` and `claude-pr-review.yml`?

| | `/review` (local) | `claude-pr-review.yml` (CI) |
|---|---|---|
| **When** | Before PR is opened (you run it manually) | After PR is opened (automatic) |
| **Scope** | Convention-level per-file checks | Systemic cross-file concerns, architecture |
| **Modifies code** | No (reports only) | No (reports only, auto-resolve modifies) |
| **Output** | Findings in terminal | Review comment on PR |

Running `/review` locally first catches the easy issues. The CI review then focuses on deeper concerns. If both run on the same PR, the CI review detects the `REVIEW_METRICS` block and skips convention checks to avoid duplication.
